### Hi, I'm Shinell 👋🏾

I'm a Software Engineer that likes to combine my passion for design with my dev and UI/UX knowledge. Creating delightful bug-free user experiences is what I strive for. In the hopes of transitioning into Fullstack Engineering, I'm experimenting with new technologies and pushing myself to make my ideas into a reality.

- 💡 I’m currently working on building a personal portfolio website and trying to create a startup that changes the job hunting process for the better.
- 🌱 Recently, I've been learning about website hosting and scaling for heavy web-traffic.
- 💬 Ask me about awesome UI/UX tools that help make designing layouts less stressful.
- 📫 How to reach me: Message me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shinell-manwaring/) (Will edit once my website is deployed)
- 👾 Fun fact: I enjoy playing videos games and I'm hoping to make a small indie game.
